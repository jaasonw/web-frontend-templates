# web frontend templates

My collection of personal use templates for frontend web development. All templates come preconfigured with the following
1. Tailwindcss
2. Prettier with mostly default settings
3. Import sorting via prettier plugin
4. Both npm and pnpm lockfiles
5. An `npm run format` command
6. Typescript if relevant

All are kept barebones because I hate having to clean up template code. Templates are kept in their own individual branches for easy cloning


# usage

Clone the specific template you want to use
```git clone -b <branch_name> https://github.com/jaasonw/web-frontend-templates.git```

Make sure you `rm -rf .git` if you'd like to initialize your own git repository. Because these were created for my personal use and convenience, I've prelicensed them with MIT with my name but the repository itself is licensed under [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/) so make sure to update `LICENSE` and `README.md` to suit your needs
